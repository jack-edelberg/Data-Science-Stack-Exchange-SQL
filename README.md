# Data Science Stack Exchange SQL
This project utilizes Stack Exchange's online API to pull and analyze trends in posts on the sub-forum Data Science Stack Exchange.

## Conclusion
In this project, I pulled a list of all the questions asked on Data Science Stack Exchange (DSSE) from the [DSSE data explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/datascience/query/new) and analyzed the data using tags and views as proxies for interest in topics in the field over time. The analysis showed:
* *Machine learning* is consistently *the most-tagged topic*.
* The *deep learning tag is growing*, while *machine learning is shrinking.*
* The *number of views per tag in 2014 was highest for deep-learning*, suggesting that although there were a small number of posts in 2014, they were massively popular.
* The number of tags used and the number of views on tags is decreasing over time. This could signal a *decrease in total activity on DSSE.*
